# Leaderboard

In this activity I set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Webpack

## Getting Started

**You'll need to have git and npm installed in you environment to follow these instructions.**
To install git go to https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
To install npm go to https://nodejs.org/en/

To get a local copy of the repository please run the following commands on your terminal:

```bash
$ cd <folder>
$ git clone git@github.com:mariordgez/todo-list.git
$ cd To-Do-List
```

To be able to run the project, you'll need to have webpack installed

```bash
$ npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

With this, you can use

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

To build the project and to start a server, respectively. `npm start` should open the page in a browser by itself, if it
doesn't, you can just access `localhost:8080` to see the project.
